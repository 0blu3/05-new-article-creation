=======
[Code of Conduct](https://github.com/codefellows/code-of-conduct)

Today we'll build a new article creation form for the blog, so authors have a nice way to write new posts.

You should be familiar with the pair flow by now. If not, review previous instructions.

## TODOs: MVP
1. We have two new libraries that we'll be working with today; highlight.js and marked.js
1. Focusing on the functionality of adding a new article through a form submission, complete the TODOs in articleView.js.
1. *Reminder: use template literals rather than string concatenation where applicable*

Now find those `TODO` items in the codebase, and tackle each one of them!

## Submit your assignment

When you are finished with lab (or if the 2 hour time limit runs out), please submit your work. To do this, you'll create *one* Pull Request (aka: "PR") to the original repo with your changes, and you'll each submit that same PR link in Canvas.

1. Ensure that all your local changes are committed, and pushed to your `origin` repo.
2. Visit the origin repo on github.com. (or just type `git open` in the terminal if you have that package installed
1. Create a new PR and ensure the branches look correct.
1. Fill in the template based on the text box prompts:
  1. Write a good descriptive summary of your changes:
    - Be sure to include how much time you spent on it, and who you worked with.
    - Briefly reflect on and summarize your process.
1. When you create the PR, it will have a unique URL. Copy this link, share with your partner, and paste it into the assignment submission form in Canvas. Both the driver and the navigator will submit the same PR link.
